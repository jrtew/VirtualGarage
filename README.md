Virtual Garage Maintenance Log

My final project for OOD course - this windows application was built with Java using Netbeans and allows multiple users to log in and add vehicles to their "virtual garage". For each vehicle, the user can pull up a maintenance log where they can add and edit maintenance records for that vehicle.

In the "dist" folder there are some sample data files with logins, vehicles, and maintenance records already created for testing purposes. To use the program, follow the instructions below.

Instructions:

To log in: All users passwords are admin

Choose a vehicle from drop box after logging in and go to maintenance log.

To add data to table: Fill in text fields under table, THEN click Add Row. THEN click Save Table to write the data to the file.

To Edit data in table: Double click in any cell, then change text and hit enter. THEN click Save Table to wirte the data to the file.
